## 🎯 **IMMEDIATE NEXT MILESTONE**

**Goal**: Complete Phase 1 (Foundation & Persistence)
**Target**: 2-3 weeks
**Key Deliverables**:
1. User authentication working
2. Sprints save to database
3. Basic creator dashboard
4. Ability to edit and manage saved sprints

**Why This First**: Without user accounts and persistence, we can't move forward with any other features. Users currently lose all their work on refresh, which makes the platform unusable for real creators.

## 🔥 **Current State vs MVP Comparison**

| Feature Category | Current | MVP Needed | Gap |
|------------------|---------|------------|-----|
| **Content Creation** | 90% ✅ | ✅ | Minor polish |
| **User Management** | 0% ❌ | ✅ | Critical gap |
| **Data Persistence** | 0% ❌ | ✅ | Critical gap |
| **Monetization** | 0% ❌ | ✅ | Major gap |
| **Participant Experience** | 0% ❌ | ✅ | Major gap |
| **Creator Dashboard** | 10% ❌ | ✅ | Major gap |

**Assessment**: We have excellent content generation capabilities but lack the fundamental platform infrastructure. We're approximately 15-20% complete toward a functional MVP.

## 📝 **Notes & Decisions**

- **Technology Stack**: Staying with React + Supabase + Tailwind is solid for this roadmap
- **AI Integration**: Current OpenAI + Hume setup is production-ready
- **Database**: Will need comprehensive schema design in Phase 1.2
- **Payments**: Stripe is the clear choice for creator payouts and participant payments
- **Email**: Will evaluate SendGrid vs Resend in Phase 3.3
